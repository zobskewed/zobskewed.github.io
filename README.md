My Philosophy on Photography

Photography for me is all about capturing the moment that appears before me. I'm not looking to setup an elaborate scene. I take what is presented and capture it as quickly and unobtrusively as possible. Because of this, my camera and lens must be minimal, elegant, and not get in the way.

I currently use a Leica Q2 (because it is pretty much the perfect fixed-lens camera) as well as a Fujifilm X-Pro3 with a Voigtlander 35mm 1.4 Nokton Classic (MC) (because I really love that lens and the Fujifilm body is an extremely pleasant pairing short of an M10R). I never use a flash because I find natural light much more pleasing. I never user a tripod because I prefer the connection between my hands, the camera, and the physical touch while taking the photo.

I work in color and black & white. I almost always shoot straight to JPG and very rarely edit a DNG/RAW file. After the photo is taken, I (almost immediately) transfer the best to my iPhone, perform minimal edits in Darkroom (or similar) to adjust contrast or highlights or shadows, maybe add some gentle vignetting or noise. If it takes more than 30 seconds I'm overthinking it. For me, photography needs to be instant and with as little friction as possible. It should be like an improvised melody - you get very little time to choose the next note - it just has to happen - and once it does, it's gone - you move on to the next. Imperfection is perfectly acceptable, in fact, desired.

Once complete, I tend to post at least one, but up to three, to Instagram to obtain my social media approval. I try not to think that 100 likes really means ~8 billion people don't care at all about my art. :-) In a few cases, a truly stellar shot will be added to my shop so others can enjoy a framed print of the work.
